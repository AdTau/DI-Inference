# Directional-Information-code
MATLAB implementation of the Directional Information estimator used in 
Tauste Campo et al., "Feed-forward information and zero-lag synchronization in the sensory thalamocortical circuit are modulated during stimulus perception", PNAS, 2019.
The code is built upon the implementation of the universal directed information estimators in Jiantao Jiao, Haim H. Permuter, Lei Zhao, Young-Han Kim, and Tsachy Weissman. "Universal estimation of directed information." IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 59, no. 10 (2013): 6220-6242. https://github.com/EEthinker/Universal_directed_information
